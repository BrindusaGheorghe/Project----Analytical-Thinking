# Project: Analytical Thinking
This is a short project looking into the shortage of affordable rents in Berlin.
You can find the raw data [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliandnl/redi_ss20/master/berlin_rental.csv).
The data was taken in 2020 from the website [immobilienscout24.](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/) It does not reflect the current housing situation in Berlin (2022).
